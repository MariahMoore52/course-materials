I chose to do option 2 which is modify the search query.
I decided to extend the page numbers which allows for the user to look at more than the first page.
I also extended the hostsearch to include the Timestamp.

How to run:
go build main.go
SHODAN_API_KEY= ./main SEARCH
Example: SHODAN_API_KEY=zQYRQgl1nJrOcZjmykeHPDHuu619iCE5 ./main city:Highlands
Type yes to continue to the first page
To quit out type anything that is not yes
