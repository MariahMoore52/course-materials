You might need to do a "go mod init bhg-scanner" or "go mod tidy"
For useage of the scanner.go and scanner_test.go files you need to have a value put in the tester or main file that specifies the port numer. 
The first thing that was changed was changing to time to DialTimeout. With this we needed to import time.
Then a slice for closedports to keep track of the closed port numbers was added.
The portscanner function also got cahanged to have two int for the return and to have a variable pass through.
The closed ports also got tracked going through the channel and then printed out.
In the scanner_test.go I added a test to test if the number of closed ports was what we wanted.
